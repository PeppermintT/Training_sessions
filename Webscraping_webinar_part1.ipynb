    "\n",
    "    1)The location (i.e., web address) where the web page can be accessed. For example, the UK Data Service homepage can be accessed via <a href=\"https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/\" target=_blank>https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/</a>.\n",
    "    2)The location of the information we are interested in within the structure of the web page. This involves visually inspecting a web page's underlying code using a web browser.\n",

    "\n",
    "    1)Request the web page using its web address.\n",
    "    2)Parse the structure of the web page so your programming language can work with its contents.\n",

    "    4)Write this information to a file for future use.\n",

    "Our task is to extract the text on this web page. In order to do so, we need to understand where the text is located within the underlying source code of the web page. Web pages are written in a langauge called HyperText Markup Language (HTML). HTML describes the structure of a web page, and consists of a number of elements (e.g., paragraphs, tables, headers), with each element represented by a tag (e.g., <p>, <table>, <h1>).\n",

    "Therefore, what we need are the tags that identify the section of the web page where the text is stored. We can discover the tags by examining the source code (HTML) of the web page.

And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family's heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith's shop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband's hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor's iron lullaby, the blacksmith's infants were rocked to slumber. Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them a care-killing competency.\n",
